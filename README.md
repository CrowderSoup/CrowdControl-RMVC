#CrowdControl RMVC

###RMVC = Repository, Model, View, Controller

RMVC is my own take on the MVC model. I have a set of Repository classes that 
handle actually GETTING data from the database (via a database wrapper) and 
putting it into the models. This helps keep your models clean and free of
clutter.

This is an eperimental framework and it is not yet ready for production use.
However, if you'd like to fork it and help me out you're more than welcome!
