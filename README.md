#CrowdControl RMVC

###RMVC = Repository, Model, View, Controller

RMVC is my own take on the MVC model. I have a set of Repository classes that 
handle actually GETTING data from the database (via a database wrapper) and 
putting it into the models. This helps keep your models clean and free of
clutter.

This was an experiment and learning experience for me and should be treated 
as such. You're more than welcome to use it as a jumping off point for your 
own projects, but it definitely not ready for production use.
